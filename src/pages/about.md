I am a software engineer with experience in JavaScript and Swift. From a very young age I have been interested in technologies, how cool and amazing they are. While playing video games I always wondered how they were made and how incredible it would be if I were able to create them. That passion stayed with me and drives me to continue to be a part of the tech industry as a software engineer.

Being able to create programs, small games and be involved with other software engineer is an experience to which I am grateful for. Currently I am working on a Swift personal project to further familiarize myself with SwiftUI and apple new programing paradigm. When I am not banging my head on the keyboard or talking to rubber ducky, I love spending time cooking and being with my family.
