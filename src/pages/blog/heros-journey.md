# A hero's Journey

This is my journey to mastering data structures and algorithms, both for myself,helpinng further develop my coding and analitical skills, as well as for being able to have an opportunity at\*\* cracking the coding interview\*\*. I plan to record my daily grid, working withLeetCode and its platform of coding challenges.

The materials and resources I will be using are:

[**SeanPrashad LeetCode patterns**](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/)
[**Grokking the Coding Interview**](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview)
[**Udemy Mastering DSA**](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/)

## Sean Prashad LeetCode Patterns

A list of the best LeetCode questions that teach you core concepts and techniques for each category/type of problems. His list is for any individual wanting to improve their problem solving skills for software engineering interviews.Problems are grouped under their respective subtopic, in order to focus on repeatedly applying common patterns rather than randomly tackling questions.All questions are available on
[**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com)

## Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions

The site is dedicated to help give:> the ability to map a new problem to an already known problem.
They help candidates with that, we've come up with a list of 16 patterns for coding questions, based on similarities in the techniques needed to solve them. As a result, once you're familiar with a pattern, you'll be able to solve dozens of problems with it.

## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure Masterclass

A Udemy course by Colt Steele on teaching you how to analyze your codeâ€™s time and space complexity using **Big O** notation.  We cover the ins and outs of **Recursion**.  We learn a 5-step approach to solving any difficult coding problem. We cover common programming patterns. We implement populars **searching algorithms**.
